	<h3>IGMP Proxy</h3>
	    <div class="row">
		<p> Enable/Disable IGMP Proxy (IPv4).<br> 
		    IGMP Proxy enables multicast forwarding based upon multicast group with IPv4 IP address membership information.<br> 
		    The proxy builds this information by processing the group membership reports (i.e. IGMP Join/Leave messages) that a multicast host on the LAN side may send.<br>
		    IGMP Proxy supports configuration of more than one Routed WAN interface as its upstream interface.</p>
	    </div>
	<h3>MLD Proxy</h3>
	    <div class="row">
		<p> Enable/Disable MLD Proxy (IPv6).<br>
		    MLD Proxy enables multicast forwarding based upon multicast group with IPv6 IP address membership information.<br>
                    The proxy builds this information by processing the group membership reports (i.e. MLD Join/Leave messages) that a multicast host on the LAN side may send.<br>
                    MLD Proxy supports configuration of more than one Routed WAN interface as its upstream interface.</p>
	    </div>
	<h3>Snooping</h3>
	    <div class="row">
		<p> Enable/Disable Multicast Snooping for both IGMP and MLD.<br> 
		    Snooping is the ability by which multicast data (at Layer2 bridge layer) will not flood but selectively forwarded only through interface on which there exist at least one host interested in multicast data.</p>
	    </div>
	<h3>Interface</h3>
	    <div class="row">
		<p> Select the WAN Interface to listen for multicast packets.<br>
		    Both IGMP and MLD supports Bridge WAN. Select the Bridge wan interface and IGMP/MLD proxy must be disabled as it is in Bridge mode and Snooping must be enabled.</p>
